		/* CLASSES
		 *  1. Classes help organize our code; they contain ATTRIBUTES(or PROPERTIES) and BEHAVIOR (or METHODS).
		 *  2. Every class contains a CONSTRUCTOR (a special type of method/instance method) that can create INSTANCES.
		 *  Ultimately, a CLASS is just a BLUEPRINT, and we need a CONSTRUCTOR to create a TRIANGLE.
		 * 
		 * INSTANCE VARIABLES AND METHODS
		 *  1. Some ATTRIBUTES are associated with each individual instance and we call these INSTANCE VARIABLES.
		 *  2. NON-STATIC instance methods/CONSTRUCTORS access the instance variables in their implementation.
		 *  eg.    Triangle triangleA = new Triangle(15,8,15,8,17);
		 *         println(triangleA.height);
		 *         
		 *         Triangle triangleB = new Triangle(3,2.598,3,3,3);
		 *         println(triangleB.getArea);
		 * 
		 * CLASS VARIABLES AND METHODS
		 *  1. Some ATTRIBUTES associated with the whole class are called CLASS variables.
		 *  2. To access these, we just need Class name and DOT (.) operator; we DON'T NEED AN INSTANCE.
		 * 
		 * eg.  println(Triangle.numOfSides);
		 *      println(Math.pow(5,2));
